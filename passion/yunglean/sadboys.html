    <h1>yung lean</h1>
    <h3><i>the father of cloud rap</i></h3>
    <hr>

    <p>jonatan aron leandoer håstad aka 'yung lean' was and continues to be an icon of influence spanning through the soundcloud scene and even in some areas of the mainstream scene. one could argue that his sense in fashion, musical delivery, and above all, aesthetic, were all miles ahead the time when his presence was first beginning to take notice.</p>

    <p>for me personally, yung lean was the catalyst into the world of the underground soundcloud scene and experiementation in music. my first dosage came on a day coming home from middle school and somehow coming across the music video for his song "yoshi city".</p>
    
    <p>what first caught my attention was his style of clothing. for the year 2014, nike tech wear wasn't the most popular yet he made it seem so sick to acquire. on top of that, his appreciation for reflective clothing and shoes, simple primarily dark or primarily light colored outfits that felt so "neo", pokemon, and oddly enough, <a href="arizona.jpg">arizona iced tea</a>. yeah, he for some reason, really liked either the drink itself, the design of the bottle, or both.</p>

    <p>perhaps it was just young version of myself at the time but I even thought that was cool. now that i'm older, I firmly believe I thought even small things like arizona tea was cool with him because I thought it complemented his vibe. everything just seemed to fit beautifully well.</p>

    <p>back to yoshi city, the second thing I quickly noticed as well was the production of the song. more specifically, the synth that was layered into it. it was truly eye-opening to hear such a sick combination of sound but ultimately, this not only opened up a world of emotional music like no other I had experienced but also introduced me to what I would later go on to learn would be the sub-genre of "cloud rap".</p>
    
    <p>one must also note, yung lean wasn't making his music all by himself. he had two close friends that went by yung sherman and yung gud. they met in a park one day and realized quickly they all three of them seemed to share the same mindset when it came to the music and it was amazing to see them all come together as teenagers to create music that would go on to impact the lives of millions around the world. soon after, they would go on to create a collective known as "sad boys" or SBE. they would later on come to meet others that had similar taste in the music they were creating and these other individuals would come to be known as "drain gang", which, although also deeply loved by me, is out of the scope of this page and fully deserves a web page of their own. </p>

    <p>it's rather beautiful to note the contrast in yung gud and yung sherman. whereas yung gud has always been known to produce music for other artists with almost ease, yung sherman has struggled being as technical and matching the sound design for others when it comes to producing alongside his struggles mentally.</p>
    
    <p>yung sherman makes quite possibly the most emotional music I have heard. his music does not require the voice of another human layered on it but simply requires his own emotions and creativity. everything by him seems deeply personal and organic. below this paragraph is his track "bleed" which is personally what I deem to be one of the most beautiful yet deeply visceral in emotion, works by him. if you are interested in hearing more by him, I recommend "I will be here", "don't go", and especially, "you are a star in my sky and i will love you forever more"</p>

    <p>ultimately, gud and sherman showed me that producing has no limits and yung lean allowed me get my first glimpse of the beautiful world of "underground" music. I actually became aware of the meaning behind that word in music from him. before realizing yung lean, I never knew that there was such distinctions such as mainstream and underground. althought yung lean has gone on to leave his signature style of melodic cloudrap behind, his core influence will never be forgotten. truthfully speaking, I only touched the surface of my love and impact for him on this web page. I will be looking to revisit this with a helper site to provide more insight into his ultimate impact on me and the years of music I would go on to experience due to him.</p>
    <p>from the purity of my introduction to a new world of music rose a new chapter of my life. one where I would go on to discover a subset of cloudrap by an artist who ultimately went on to become one of the most, if not the most, impactful <a href="cloudboysceo.jpg">individual</a> in my life not just for cloudrap but for music as a whole. </p>
