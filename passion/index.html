    <p>my love for music has always been present. having an older sibling helped me hear different genres of music but the only ones that truly stood out to me were hip-hop and rap. I remember listening to Lil Wayne's iconic album "I Am Not a Human Being" on a bus to a field trip to D.C. in grade 5 with my favorite song on there being "Right Above It" featuring a young Drake. my song library only continued growing and the storage on my iPod only continued decreasing but it wasn't until 7th grade that I came across an <a href="yunglean/sadboys.html">artist</a> that truly made me look at music entirely differently than before.  </p>

    <p>sub-genres close to my heart â™¡:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cloud rap</li>
        <li>emo-rap/trap punk/alternative r&b...</li>
        <li>glitchcore/"hyperpop"</li>
    </ul>
